# Netflix Movie Database Analysis

## Dataset

> The dataset contains details of movies released on Netflix from 2008 to 2021. There were 7789 entries in this dataset with 11 features. During the cleanup process, more features were added namely, Year, minutes and units to make it 14 features. A new dataframe had to be created where all null values were dropped. I got this dataset from Data Science Lovers on Youtube. The dataset can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p630pDcSkbQp_WXig8PeEVevZtSo4GQK/view). Several questions were asked during the course of this analysis, they include,
